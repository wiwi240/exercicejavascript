# JavaScript Exercise

## Description

This project contains several JavaScript exercises for learning the basics of the language. It includes interactive scripts executed in the browser via an HTML page.

## Project Structure

```
├── index.html         # Main page that loads the JS scripts
├── script01.js        # Displays messages and handles user input
├── script02.js        # Calculates the factorial of a number
├── script03.js        # Builds and displays a pyramid in the console
├── script04.js        # Present, currently empty
├── script05.js        # Present, currently empty
└── README.md          # This documentation file
```

## Usage

1. **Open the `index.html` file in a browser** to run the JavaScript scripts.
2. By default, the `script02.js` is loaded. You can change the `<script src="..."></script>` tag in `index.html` to test another script.

## Script Details

- **script01.js**:
	- Displays "Bonjour Monde" in the console.
	- Asks the user's first name and displays it in the console.
- **script02.js**:
	- Asks the user for a number and calculates its factorial.
	- Displays the result in the console.
- **script03.js**:
	- Asks the user how many levels for a pyramid.
	- Builds and displays a pyramid of that height in the console using spaces and # characters.
- **script04.js**:
	- Contains an array of famous entrepreneurs.
	- Displays entrepreneurs born in the 1970s.

	- Finds the most and least rented books.
	- Finds a book by its ID.
	- Removes a book by its ID and displays the updated array.
- **index.html**:
