# JavaScript Exercise

## Description

This project contains several JavaScript exercises for learning the basics of the language. It includes interactive scripts executed in the browser via an HTML page.

## Project Structure

```
├── index.html         # Main page that loads the JS scripts
├── script01.js        # Script for displaying messages and user input
├── script02.js        # Script for calculating the factorial of a number
├── script03.js        # (Empty, ready for future exercises)
└── README.md          # This documentation file
```

## Usage

1. **Open the `index.html` file in a browser** to run the JavaScript scripts.
2. By default, the `script02.js` is loaded. You can change the `<script src="..."></script>` tag in `index.html` to test another script.

## Script Details

- **script01.js**:

	- Asks the user's first name and displays it in the console.
- **script02.js**:

	- Displays the result in the console.
